# Hello GraphQL subscriptions, with a python back end...

This repo contains a minimal example of 
* subscriptions
* running React (Apollo) on the front end, and
* a python graphqQL server on the back end.

The repo was forked from: https://github.com/GraphQLCollege/apollo-subscriptions-example. This was the simplest working example that I could find with of GraphQL subscriptions running on modern versions of React, GraphQL, and Apollo

After forking, the major addition is `python_server/`, which replicates the functionality of `packages/server/` in python (graphene).
I also made some minor changes to `packages/client/src/App.js` for compatibility.


The README from the original repo is below.
